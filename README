This is yet another ridiculously simple shell script which changes the SubRip subtitle files as per user input. The subtitles can be delayed or advanced. 

Most of the times, mplayer/VLC subtitle delay doesnt work properly. Atleast it never worked for me. Also, even if it works, the next time you play the video, you have to sync it again.

In such cases this comes as a permanent solution!

This takes a bit time depending on the subtitle file size.
